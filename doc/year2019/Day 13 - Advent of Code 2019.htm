Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 13: Care Package ---</h2><p>As you ponder the solitude of space and the ever-increasing three-hour roundtrip for messages between you and Earth, you notice that the Space Mail Indicator Light is blinking.  To help keep you sane, the Elves have sent you a care package.</p>
<p>It's a new game for the ship's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_cabinet">arcade cabinet</a>! Unfortunately, the arcade is <em>all the way</em> on the other end of the ship. Surely, it won't be hard to build your own - the care package even comes with schematics.</p>
<p>The arcade cabinet runs <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9">Intcode</a> software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square <em>tiles</em> on a grid.  The software draws tiles to the screen with output instructions: every three output instructions specify the <code>x</code> position (distance from the left), <code>y</code> position (distance from the top), and <code>tile id</code>. The <code>tile id</code> is interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> is an <em>empty</em> tile.  No game object appears in this tile.</li>
<li><code>1</code> is a <em>wall</em> tile.  Walls are indestructible barriers.</li>
<li><code>2</code> is a <em>block</em> tile.  Blocks can be broken by the ball.</li>
<li><code>3</code> is a <em>horizontal paddle</em> tile.  The paddle is indestructible.</li>
<li><code>4</code> is a <em>ball</em> tile.  The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a sequence of output values like <code>1,2,3,6,5,4</code> would draw a <em>horizontal paddle</em> tile (<code>1</code> tile from the left and <code>2</code> tiles from the top) and a <em>ball</em> tile (<code>6</code> tiles from the left and <code>5</code> tiles from the top).</p>
<p>Start the game. <em>How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>226</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The game didn't run because you didn't put in any quarters. Unfortunately, you did not bring any <span title="You do have crew quarters, but they won&#39;t fit in the machine.">quarters</span>. Memory address <code>0</code> represents the number of quarters that have been inserted; set it to <code>2</code> to play for free.</p>
<p>The arcade cabinet has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick">joystick</a> that can move left and right.  The software reads the position of the joystick with input instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the joystick is in the <em>neutral position</em>, provide <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>If the joystick is <em>tilted to the left</em>, provide <code>-1</code>.</li>
<li>If the joystick is <em>tilted to the right</em>, provide <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The arcade cabinet also has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device#Segment_displays">segment display</a> capable of showing a single number that represents the player's current score. When three output instructions specify <code>X=-1, Y=0</code>, the third output instruction is not a tile; the value instead specifies the new score to show in the segment display.  For example, a sequence of output values like <code>-1,0,12345</code> would show <code>12345</code> as the player's current score.</p>
<p>Beat the game by breaking all the blocks. <em>What is your score after the last block is broken?</em></p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>10800</code>.</p><p class="day-success">Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: **</p>
<p>At this point, you should <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019">return to your Advent calendar</a> and try another puzzle.</p>
