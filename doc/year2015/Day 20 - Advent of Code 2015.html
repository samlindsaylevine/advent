Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, and a few even longer than that. A
lot of effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it
as much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Each Elf is assigned a number, too, and delivers presents to houses based on that number:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first Elf (number <code>1</code>) delivers presents to every house: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, ....</li>
<li>The second Elf (number <code>2</code>) delivers presents to every second house: <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>10</code>, ....</li>
<li>Elf number <code>3</code> delivers presents to every third house: <code>3</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>12</code>, <code>15</code>, ....</li>
</ul>
<p>There are infinitely many Elves, numbered starting with <code>1</code>.  Each Elf delivers presents equal to <em>ten times</em> his or her number at each house.</p>
<p>So, the first nine houses on the street end up like this:</p>
<pre><code>House 1 got 10 presents.
House 2 got 30 presents.
House 3 got 40 presents.
House 4 got 70 presents.
House 5 got 60 presents.
House 6 got 120 presents.
House 7 got 80 presents.
House 8 got 150 presents.
House 9 got 130 presents.
</code></pre>
<p>The first house gets <code>10</code> presents: it is visited only by Elf <code>1</code>, which delivers <code>1 * 10 = 10</code> presents.  The fourth house gets <code>70</code> presents, because it is visited by Elves <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>4</code>, for a total of <code>10 + 20 + 40 = 70</code> presents.</p>
<p>What is the <em>lowest house number</em> of the house to get at least as many presents as the number in your puzzle input?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>665280</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The Elves decide they don't want to visit an infinite number of houses.  Instead, each Elf will stop after delivering presents to <code>50</code> houses.  To make up for it, they decide to deliver presents equal to <em>eleven times</em> their number at each house.</p>
<p>With these changes, what is the new <em>lowest house number</em> of the house to get at least as many presents as the number in your puzzle input?</p>
