This annotation of the input program, for analyzing the second half of the problem, consists of the
input with line numbers and comments.

     0	set b 93
     1	set c b
     2	jnz a 2

This instruction is always executed in the second part and we go to line 4.

     3	jnz 1 5

To line 8. Executed only in the first part. We end up with b=93, c=93.

     4	mul b 100
     5	sub b -100000
     6	set c b
     7	sub c -17000

This section is executed in (and only in) the second part. We end up with b=109300, c=126300.

Nothing before this point is ever revisited under any circumstances, and a and c are never changed.

     8	set f 1
     9	set d 2
    10	set e 2


    11	set g d
    12	mul g e
    13	sub g b
    14	jnz g 2
    15	set f 0

If d * e = b, then set f to 0. Otherwise leave it at 1.

    16	sub e -1
    17	set g e
    18	sub g b
    19	jnz g -8

Add one to e. Then, if e = b, continue. Otherwise return to line 11 (leaving the current values of e, d, and f).

    20	sub d -1
    21	set g d
    22	sub g b
    23	jnz g -13

Add one to d. Then, if d = b, continue. Otherwise return to line 10. (Resetting e to 2,
but leaving the current values of d and f.)

    24	jnz f 2
    25	sub h -1

If f is 0 (i.e., if d * e = b for any values of d and e ranging from 2 up to b - i.e., b is composite) then
add one to h. Otherwise, move on.

    26	set g b
    27	sub g c
    28	jnz g 2
    29	jnz 1 3

If b = c, end the program; otherwise, continue to line 30.

    30	sub b -17
    31	jnz 1 -23

Add 17 to b, then start over from line 8.

The entire program can thus be summarized as

"Ranging from 109300 to 126300 (inclusive), stepping by 17s, how many of those numbers are composite?"
