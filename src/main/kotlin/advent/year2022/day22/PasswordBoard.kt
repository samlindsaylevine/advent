/**
 * --- Day 22: Monkey Map ---
 * The monkeys take you on a surprisingly easy trail through the jungle. They're even going in roughly the right
 * direction according to your handheld device's Grove Positioning System.
 * As you walk, the monkeys explain that the grove is protected by a force field. To pass through the force field, you
 * have to enter a password; doing so involves tracing a specific path on a strangely-shaped board.
 * At least, you're pretty sure that's what you have to do; the elephants aren't exactly fluent in monkey.
 * The monkeys give you notes that they took when they last saw the password entered (your puzzle input).
 * For example:
 *         ...#
 *         .#..
 *         #...
 *         ....
 * ...#.......#
 * ........#...
 * ..#....#....
 * ..........#.
 *         ...#....
 *         .....#..
 *         .#......
 *         ......#.
 *
 * 10R5L5R10L4R5L5
 *
 * The first half of the monkeys' notes is a map of the board. It is comprised of a set of open tiles (on which you can
 * move, drawn .) and solid walls (tiles which you cannot enter, drawn #).
 * The second half is a description of the path you must follow. It consists of alternating numbers and letters:
 *
 * A number indicates the number of tiles to move in the direction you are facing. If you run into a wall, you stop
 * moving forward and continue with the next instruction.
 * A letter indicates whether to turn 90 degrees clockwise (R) or counterclockwise (L). Turning happens in-place; it
 * does not change your current tile.
 *
 * So, a path like 10R5 means "go forward 10 tiles, then turn clockwise 90 degrees, then go forward 5 tiles".
 * You begin the path in the leftmost open tile of the top row of tiles. Initially, you are facing to the right (from
 * the perspective of how the map is drawn).
 * If a movement instruction would take you off of the map, you wrap around to the other side of the board. In other
 * words, if your next tile is off of the board, you should instead look in the direction opposite of your current
 * facing as far as you can until you find the opposite edge of the board, then reappear there.
 * For example, if you are at A and facing to the right, the tile in front of you is marked B; if you are at C and
 * facing down, the tile in front of you is marked D:
 *         ...#
 *         .#..
 *         #...
 *         ....
 * ...#.D.....#
 * ........#...
 * B.#....#...A
 * .....C....#.
 *         ...#....
 *         .....#..
 *         .#......
 *         ......#.
 *
 * It is possible for the next tile (after wrapping around) to be a wall; this still counts as there being a wall in
 * front of you, and so movement stops before you actually wrap to the other side of the board.
 * By drawing the last facing you had with an arrow on each tile you visit, the full path taken by the above example
 * looks like this:
 *         >>v#
 *         .#v.
 *         #.v.
 *         ..v.
 * ...#...v..v#
 * >>>v...>#.>>
 * ..#v...#....
 * ...>>>>v..#.
 *         ...#....
 *         .....#..
 *         .#......
 *         ......#.
 *
 * To finish providing the password to this strange input device, you need to determine numbers for your final row,
 * column, and facing as your final position appears from the perspective of the original map. Rows start from 1 at the
 * top and count downward; columns start from 1 at the left and count rightward. (In the above example, row 1, column 1
 * refers to the empty space with no tile on it in the top-left corner.) Facing is 0 for right (>), 1 for down (v), 2
 * for left (<), and 3 for up (^). The final password is the sum of 1000 times the row, 4 times the column, and the
 * facing.
 * In the above example, the final row is 6, the final column is 8, and the final facing is 0. So, the final password
 * is 1000 * 6 + 4 * 8 + 0: 6032.
 * Follow the path given in the monkeys' notes. What is the final password?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * As you reach the force field, you think you hear some Elves in the distance. Perhaps they've already arrived?
 * You approach the strange input device, but it isn't quite what the monkeys drew in their notes. Instead, you are met
 * with a large cube; each of its six faces is a square of 50x50 tiles.
 * To be fair, the monkeys' map does have six 50x50 regions on it. If you were to carefully fold the map, you should be
 * able to shape it into a cube!
 * In the example above, the six (smaller, 4x4) faces of the cube are:
 *         1111
 *         1111
 *         1111
 *         1111
 * 222233334444
 * 222233334444
 * 222233334444
 * 222233334444
 *         55556666
 *         55556666
 *         55556666
 *         55556666
 *
 * You still start in the same position and with the same facing as before, but the wrapping rules are different. Now,
 * if you would walk off the board, you instead proceed around the cube. From the perspective of the map, this can look
 * a little strange. In the above example, if you are at A and move to the right, you would arrive at B facing down; if
 * you are at C and move down, you would arrive at D facing up:
 *         ...#
 *         .#..
 *         #...
 *         ....
 * ...#.......#
 * ........#..A
 * ..#....#....
 * .D........#.
 *         ...#..B.
 *         .....#..
 *         .#......
 *         ..C...#.
 *
 * Walls still block your path, even if they are on a different face of the cube. If you are at E facing up, your
 * movement is blocked by the wall marked by the arrow:
 *         ...#
 *         .#..
 *      -->#...
 *         ....
 * ...#..E....#
 * ........#...
 * ..#....#....
 * ..........#.
 *         ...#....
 *         .....#..
 *         .#......
 *         ......#.
 *
 * Using the same method of drawing the last facing you had with an arrow on each tile you visit, the full path taken
 * by the above example now looks like this:
 *         >>v#
 *         .#v.
 *         #.v.
 *         ..v.
 * ...#..^...v#
 * .>>>>>^.#.>>
 * .^#....#....
 * .^........#.
 *         ...#..v.
 *         .....#v.
 *         .#v<<<<.
 *         ..v...#.
 *
 * The final password is still calculated from your final position and facing from the perspective of the map. In this
 * example, the final row is 5, the final column is 7, and the final facing is 3, so the final password is 1000 * 5 + 4
 * * 7 + 3 = 5031.
 * Fold the map into a cube, then follow the path given in the monkeys' notes. What is the final password?
