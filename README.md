This is a set of solutions for the code puzzles at [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com).

You might not want to look at them until you have tried out the puzzles yourself! They were fun.

The problem statements are all saved here, for your reference, under the doc folder. (The problems are not all visible on the official site until you have solved each previous puzzle.)

These solutions can be a little bit hasty, not particularly documented, etc., since I was putting them together solely for my own personal satisfaction. They should still be comprehensible to the casual reader (who is also reading the problem document). They are reasonably unit tested.
