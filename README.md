ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

This is a set of solutions for the code puzzles at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com). 

Advent of Code is a fun annual event, with a puzzle each day for the first 25 days of December. The puzzles can be solved in any language. Each day has 2 parts, so there is some incentive to write readable, evolvable programs - and then some common elements can be reused between days, too. 

I've been participating in Advent of Code since 2016 (when I also went back and solved 2015), and it's one of the highlights of my holiday season.

These solutions can be a little bit hasty, not particularly documented, etc., since I was putting them together primarily for my own personal satisfaction. They should still be comprehensible to the casual reader (who is also reading the problem document). They are reasonably unit tested.
The problem statements are all saved here, for your reference, under the doc folder. (The second part of each problem is not visible on the official site until you have solved the first part.)

Note that 2015 and 2016 are under src/[main|test]/java and later years are under src/[main|test]/kotlin.
