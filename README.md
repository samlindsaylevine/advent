This is a set of solutions for the code puzzles at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com).

The problem statements are all saved here, for your reference, under the doc folder. (The problems are not all visible on the official site until you have solved each previous puzzle.)

These solutions can be a little bit hasty, not particularly documented, etc., since I was putting them together primarily for my own personal satisfaction. They should still be comprehensible to the casual reader (who is also reading the problem document). They are reasonably unit tested.

Note that 2015 and 2016 are under src/[main|test]/java and 2017 and 2018 are under src/[main|test]/kotlin.
