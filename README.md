This is a set of solutions for the code puzzles at [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com).

You might not want to look at them until you have tried out the puzzles yourself! They were fun.

These solutions are a little bit hasty, not particularly documented, etc., since I was putting them together solely for my own personal satisfaction. Hopefully the problem space is simple enough that they are still comprehensible to the casual reader (who is also reading the problem document).
